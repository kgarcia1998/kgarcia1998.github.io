								<p>Hello there, and welcome to my webpage! My name is Kevin A. Garcia Bojorquez, and I'm excited to share a little bit about myself with you.</p>
								<p>In June of 2022, I graduated from CETYS Universidad with a degree in Computer Science and a GPA of 3.7. During my time at CETYS, I gained valuable knowledge and experience that prepared me for my career. I also unknowingly started to develop a taste for analytics. Now looking back on my time there, the clases which I found most appealing were those that included statistical analysis and graphing data.</p>
								<p>After graduation, I had the privilege of continuing to work at Insulet Corporation where I was a Trainee Software Tester from February 2022 to January 2023. While there, I analyzed users stories and use cases/requirements for validity and feasibility, collaborated closely with other team members and departments,executed all levels of testing, and applied quality engineering principals throughout the Agile product life-cycle. </p>
								<p>In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, hiking, playing videogames, keeping up with the news, and walking my dogs. I believe that a balance between work and play is essential for a happy and fulfilling life.</p>
								<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I hope that you found this information helpful and that it gives you a better idea of who I am as a person and a professional.</p>
